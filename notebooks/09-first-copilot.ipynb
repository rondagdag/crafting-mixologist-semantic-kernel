    "# Introduction to a Copilot\n",

    "An agent is an artificial intelligence that can answer questions and automate processes for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel offers tools to build AI agents, ranging from basic chatbots to advanced AI assistants, without needing deep AI expertise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Copilot agent - Unlike fully automated agents, copilots work alongside users, aiding in tasks like writing emails by offering suggestions that users can accept or reject. This approach keeps the user in control, making copilots simpler and safer to develop. As proficiency grows, one can evolve these copilots into fully automated agents by minimizing user input.\n",
